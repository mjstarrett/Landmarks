Imagined Navigation
You will now mentally simulate navigating to the {0}. If you just found the 
{0}, please simulate the same route you took to arrive there from the preceeding
target. If the last target you found was not the {0}, please simulate the route you
would take to get there, starting from your current location.

When you are at your imagined starting point and ready to simulate your route, press 
the button to continue. When you arrive at the {0}, press any button to continue 
the experiment.
