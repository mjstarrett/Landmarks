Navigation + Visualization

You will be required to -EITHER- navigate to a target in the environment 
and then visualize that route -OR- visualize navigating to a target from 
your current or last known location in the environment. In both cases, there 
is no time limit, so you will need to navigate to the current destination 
before continuing on to the next trial or task.
