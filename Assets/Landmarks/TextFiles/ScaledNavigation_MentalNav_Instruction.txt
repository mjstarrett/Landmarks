Scale Navigation + Visualization

You will be required to -EITHER- navigate your avatar to a target in 
the scaled environment and then visualize that route -OR- visualize 
navigating your avatar to a target from the avatar's' current or last 
known location in the scaled environment. In both cases, there is no 
time limit, so you will need to navigate the avatar to the current 
destination before continuing on to the next trial or task.
